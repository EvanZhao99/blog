# Getting Started with Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.

## Installation

### Redux Toolkit

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

RTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including [store setup](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore),
[creating reducers and writing immutable update logic](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createreducer),
and even [creating entire "slices" of state at once](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice).

Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your first project, or an experienced user who wants to
simplify an existing application, **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** can help you
make your Redux code better.

Redux Toolkit is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```bash
# NPM
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

# Yarn
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

### Create a React Redux App

The recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux is by using the [official Redux+JS template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which takes advantage of **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** and React Redux's integration with React components.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux
```

### Redux Core

The Redux core library is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```bash
# NPM
npm install redux

# Yarn
yarn add redux
```

It is also available as a precompiled UMD package that defines a `window.Redux` global variable. The UMD package can be used as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) directly.

For more details, see the [Installation](Installation.md) page.

## Basic Example

The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an _action_, an object describing what happened.
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure _reducers_.

That's it!

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

/**
 * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.
 * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.
 *
 * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,
 * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that
 * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your
 * project.
 */
function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counter)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
// 1
```

Instead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.

In a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.

This architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.

## Should You Use Redux?

Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. **Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it**.

Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:

- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
- You need a single source of truth for your state
- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient
